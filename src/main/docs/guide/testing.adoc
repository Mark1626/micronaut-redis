You can run an embedded version of Redis for testing and CI scenarios by adding a dependency on the Embedded Redis project:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
testCompile "com.github.kstyrc:embedded-redis:0.6"
----

If Redis is unavailable for the configured Redis URI an embedded instance of Redis will be automatically started and then shutdown at the end of the test (when `stop` is called on the `ApplicationContext`).
