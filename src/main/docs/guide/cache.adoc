If you wish to use Redis to cache results then you need to have the Lettuce configuration dependency on your classpath. Lettuce is a non-blocking, reactive Redis client implementation and Micronaut provides an implementation that allows cached results to be read reactively.

Within your application configuration configure the Redis URL and Redis caches:

redis:
    uri: redis://localhost

        my-cache:
            # expire one hour after write
            expire-after-write: 1h
